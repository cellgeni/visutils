  feature,
  conditions,
  cols = NULL,
  sd.mult = 2,
  legend. = TRUE,
  ylim = NULL,
  scaleY = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{3d (distance/feature/sample) numeric matrix with summarized data (output of makeDistFeatureSampleTable)}

\item{feature}{single character, name of feature to be plotted (from second dimension of m)}

\item{conditions}{vector specifying conditions of all samples (along third dimension of m)}

\item{cols}{named (by conditions) color vector. Only conditions mentioned here will be shown. Colours are aoutogenerated by char2col if null (default)}

\item{sd.mult}{width of CI shown by shade expressed in standart deviations of mean}

\item{legend.}{logical, whether logend should be plotted, or list with parameters to be passed to legend function.}

\item{ylim}{ylim to be set, set by data if NULL (default)}

\item{scaleY}{whether all features should be scaled by its max value (to bring all features to the same scale)}

\item{area.opacity}{opacity of CI shade}

\item{lwd}{line width}

\item{xlab, ylab, main}{plot annotation}

\item{...}{other parameters to be passed to plot}
